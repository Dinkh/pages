# Welcome to neo.mjs! (Beta Version)
This is a new paradigm. If you want to enter a new era of making better Web Based User Interfaces,
the following concepts will be addictive.

## COVID19 IN NUMBERS Demo App
The most compelling way to introduce a new framework might simply be to show what you can do with it.

<a href="https://neomjs.github.io/pages/node_modules/neo.mjs/dist/production/apps/covid/index.html#mainview=table">Live Demo: COIN App dist/production</a></br>
Desktop only; support for mobile devices is on the roadmap)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhSZS6_UlO4">Demo Video on YouTube</a></br>
Just clicking around randomly, but might give you an idea on you to navigate inside the helix and gallery.

You can find the code of the covid app <a href="https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/apps/covid">here</a>.

## Online Examples
You can find a full list of (desktop based) online examples here:</br>

You can pick between the 3 modes (development, dist/development, dist/production) for each one.

Still here? Welcome to neo.mjs - The webworkers driven UI framework

## Ready to get started?
There are 3 different ways on how you can get the basics running locally.</br>
Please take a look at the <a href=".github/GETTING_STARTED.md">Getting Started Guide</a>.

## Project History
neo.mjs got released to the public on November 23, 2019.</br>
Before this point, the project was already at 3720 commits.<br>
Find out more about the start of it inside the <a href=".github/NEOMJS_HISTORY.md">Project History</a> file.

## Story & Vision
Although neo.mjs is ready to craft beautiful & blazing fast UIs,</br>
the current state is just a fraction of a bigger picture.

Take a look at the <a href=".github/STORY.md">Project Story</a> and <a href=".github/VISION.md">Vision</a>.

## Sponsors are needed!
Is the current code base useful for you or could it be in the future?</br>
Do you like the neo.mjs concepts?</br>
So far the development was made possible with burning all of my (tobiu's) personal savings.</br>

This is obviously not sustainable, so to enable me to keep pushing like this, please support it.</br>
The benefit of doing so is to get results delivered faster.

Here you go: <a href="./BACKERS.md">Sponsors & Backers</a>

## Contributors are needed!
Another way to fasten up the neo.mjs development speed is to actively jump in.</br>
As the shiny "PRs welcome" badge suggests: open source is intended to be improved by anyone who is up for the challenge.

You can also write a guide in case you learned something new using neo.mjs or just help getting more eyes on this project.

Either way, here are more infos: <a href="./CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing</a>

There are some Javascript legends hiding in the shadows and waiting to be discovered.</br>
